# Employee-burnout-analysis
This repository contains a data science project aimed at analyzing employee burnout using various machine learning techniques and visualization tools. The project leverages Python libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to gain insights into factors contributing to employee burnout.

## Introduction
Employee burnout is a critical issue in workplaces, affecting productivity and employee well-being. This project analyzes burnout data to identify key factors and predict burnout levels using machine learning models. The insights derived can help organizations implement effective interventions.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Scaled and normalized the data using `StandardScaler`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized trends and correlations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Trained models including `LinearRegression`, `RandomForestRegressor`, and support vector regressors (`LinearSVR`, `SVR`).
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score.
4. **Model Deployment (Optional):**
   - Saved models using `pickle` for reuse.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

```python
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn (scikit-learn)
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- dateutil
- pickle
- os
```

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib python-dateutil
```

## Features
- **Data Handling:** Efficient preprocessing and handling of missing values.
- **Visualization:** Clear and insightful visualizations for understanding burnout trends.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Multiple machine learning models to predict burnout levels.
- **Performance Metrics:** Comprehensive evaluation of models.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-burnout-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd employee-burnout-analysis
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Employee_burnout_analysis.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore, preprocess, and analyze the data.

> **Note:** This project uses the `employee_burnout_analysis.xlsx` file as the primary dataset for analysis.

## Results
The project achieved the following outcomes:
- Identification of key factors contributing to burnout.
- Comparative analysis of machine learning models, with `RandomForestRegressor` showing the best performance.
- Visualizations showcasing data trends and model predictions.
